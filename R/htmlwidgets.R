# Creates a list of keys whose values need to be evaluated on the client-side.
#
# It works by transforming \code{list(foo = list(1, list(bar =
# I('function(){}')), 2))} to \code{list("foo.2.bar")}. Later on the JS side, we
# will split foo.2.bar to ['foo', '2', 'bar'] and evaluate the JSON object
# member. Note '2' (character) should have been 2 (integer) but it does not seem
# to matter in JS: x[2] is the same as x['2'] when all child members of x are
# unnamed, and ('2' in x) will be true even if x is an array without names. This
# is a little hackish.
#
# @param list a list in which the elements that should be evaluated as
#   JavaScript are to be identified
